## Deployment Workflow

The deployment process is automated using GitHub Actions. Here's how it works:

Trigger: On every push to the main branch.

Build: The workflow checks out the code and prepares it for deployment.

Deploy: The static files are deployed to the gh-pages branch, which GitHub Pages uses to serve the website.
