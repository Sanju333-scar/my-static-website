# **My Static Website with CI/CD Deployment**

Welcome to my static website project! This repository showcases my journey into DevOps, where I've implemented a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate the deployment of a static website.

## **Acknowledgment**

This project is a modified version of https://github.com/cloudacademy/static-website-example. I've refactored and extended it, implementing GitHub Actions for CI/CD deployment and hosting via GitHub Pages.

---

## **Project Overview**

- **Template Used**: Dimension by HTML5 UP  
- **Hosting Platform**: GitHub Pages  
- **CI/CD Tool**: GitHub Actions

---

## **Objectives**

- Fork and customize an existing static website template.  
- Implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.  
- Automate the deployment process to GitHub Pages.  
- Gain hands-on experience in DevOps practices.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **HTML5 & CSS3** – For structuring and styling the website.  
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and repository hosting.  
- **GitHub Actions** – Automating the build and deployment process.  
- **GitHub Pages** – Hosting the static website.

---

## **Deployment Workflow**

The deployment process is automated using GitHub Actions. Here's how it works:

1. **Trigger**: On every push to the `main` branch.  
2. **Build**: The workflow checks out the code and prepares it for deployment.  
3. **Deploy**: The static files are deployed to the `gh-pages` branch, which GitHub Pages uses to serve the website.  
4. The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
